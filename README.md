# CustomIdentityAuth

A .NET 8 project that customizes authentication processes using ASP.NET Identity, providing features like JWT, refresh tokens, and role management for flexible and secure identity management. This project focuses on researching and implementing best practices to ensure robust and maintainable solutions.

## Features

- **ASP.NET Identity Integration**: Leverages ASP.NET Identity for managing users, roles, and claims.
- **JWT Authentication**: Implements JSON Web Tokens for secure user authentication.
- **Refresh Tokens**: Provides mechanisms for refreshing JWTs to maintain user sessions securely.
- **Role Management**: Includes role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions.
- **Custom Result Types**: Utilizes custom result types to enhance the clarity and robustness of API responses.
- **Seed Data**: Implements seed data to initialize the application with default users and roles.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ersin-kaya/CustomIdentityAuth.git
    cd CustomIdentityAuth
    ```

2. **Set up the database:**

    - Update the connection string in `appsettings.json` to point to your SQL Server instance.

3. **Apply migrations:**

    ```bash
    dotnet ef database update
    ```

4. **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

### Testing

You can use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) to test the API endpoints. Swagger is configured in the project and can be accessed by navigating to `/swagger` when the application is running.

## Usage

- **Authentication:**
  - Use the `/api/auth/login` endpoint to authenticate users.
  - Use the `/api/auth/refresh-token` endpoint to refresh JWTs.

- **User Management:**
  - Use the `/api/users` endpoint to manage users.
  - Use the `/api/roles` endpoint to manage roles.
